# Utils
Load any file with jsDelivr CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sokigit/utils@latest/<path to the file you want to load>` (loads the latest version)
## Example:
- Loading the localStorage javascript module: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sokigit/utils@latest/js/localStorage.mjs`
## Loading a specific version:
Same as the template for latest except you replace the `latest` in the URL with the specific version.
So the new template looks like this: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sokigit/utils@<version>/<path to the file you want to load>`
